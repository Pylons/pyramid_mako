Next Release
============

- Caller-relative template lookup is now supported. To enable this feature,
  do *not* specify the ``mako.directories`` setting in your configuration.
  All templates specified as non-absolute paths will be discovered relative
  to the caller package.

- Allow overriding the ``pyramid.reload_templates`` using
  ``mako.reload_templates``.

0.3.1 (2013-10-22)
==================

- Re-enable lazy loading of the mako renderer, allowing the settings
  to be configured after pyramid_mako has been included, as long as everything
  happens in the same commit.

0.3 (2013-10-20)
================

- Add a new Configurator directive, ``config.add_mako_renderer`` which
  can be used to add a new mako renderer for a given extension. This
  directive accepts an optional ``settings_prefix`` to load settings and
  configuration differently per-renderer as well.

- Removed the private APIs, ``IMakoLookup``, ``MakoRendererFactoryHelper``,
  and ``renderer_factory``. See the new ``config.add_mako_renderer`` API
  for updating offending code.

- Remove dependency on ``pyramid.interfaces.ITemplateRenderer`` from
  Pyramid 1.5.

- Latest changes pulled from Pyramid
- Latest tests pulled from Pyramid
- All tests updated to refer to fixtures in pyramid_mako

0.1 (2012-03-12)
